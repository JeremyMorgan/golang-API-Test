API Tester written in Golang
===============

Test API written in GoLang. This is a simulation of the API tester I wrote for this article:

http://www.jeremymorgan.com/blog/programming/how-to-create-asp-self-hosted-api/

The self hosted API in the article was written in C#/ASP and decided to recreate it using Google Go.

I borrowed the goweb code to serve it up, this is just an experiment to be expanded upon later. 

Test was compiled with go1.2.2 in Arch Linux (3.14.1-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Mon Apr 14 20:40:47 CEST 2014 x86_64 GNU/Linux)

API Usage:
